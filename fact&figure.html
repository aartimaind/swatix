        <h1 align="center">Facts and figures</h1>
        <h3 align="center">Oxford was ranked first in the world in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.
          There are more than 25,000 students at Oxford, including 12,510 undergraduates and 13,044 postgraduates.
          Entry to undergraduate courses at Oxford continues to be very competitive: there are usually only around 3,300 places, and over 24,000 people applied to start in 2021.
          The majority of Oxford’s UK undergraduates come from state schools. Over 68% of UK students admitted in 2021 were from the state sector.
          Oxford offers more than 350 postgraduate programmes.
          For 2020/21 entry, over 34,500 applications were received for some 6,675 postgraduate places.
          International students make up almost 45% of our total student body - around 11,500 students. Students come to Oxford from more than 160 countries and territories. 
          According to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, the official UK-wide assessment of all university research, Oxford has the largest volume of world-leading research in the UK.
          The University of Oxford contributes around £15.7 billion to the UK economy, and supports more than 28,000 full time jobs (2018/19). 
          Vision
The University’s buildings and estate are not only necessary for our academic work; they also contribute to Oxford’s reputation as a city of learning, heritage and culture. They form a vital part of the rich architecture of the city and provide a beautiful environment for visitors and Oxford residents, as well as University staff and students.

The University’s estate, comprising buildings for research, teaching, learning, and administration, has been growing at around 5% a year for the last 15 years. Today there are around 260 buildings across 13 sites in and around Oxford.

We aim to provide our staff and students with state-of-the-art facilities within an inspiring and historic setting, to improve opportunities for interdisciplinary working, and to minimise our environmental impact.

We invest in the estate to enable new or improved ways of working; this includes the decommissioning and transformation of inappropriate spaces. How we manage and develop the estate is underpinned by our environmental policies. To support this investment, we have on average of 80 building and refurbishment projects ongoing at any one time, with an annual expenditure in excess of £100m. This cost is met through a combination of University funds, Government grants and initiatives, and donations.</h3>
