        <h3 align="center">Oxford is a world-leading center of learning, teaching and research and the oldest university in the English-speaking world.</h3>
        <p align="center">
            Oxford is an independent and self-governing institution consisting of the University, its divisions, departments and faculties, and the colleges.
            
            The colleges and halls
            The 36 colleges and three societies are a core element of the University, to which they are related via a federal system.
            
            Each college is independent and self-governing, having a charter approved by the Privy Council, under which it is governed by a Head of House, elected and appointed by the governing body directly. The governing body comprises a number of Fellows, most of whom also hold University posts.
            
            The three societies – Kellogg College, Reuben College and St Cross College – operate very much like the other colleges but are considered departments of the University rather than independent colleges because, unlike the others, they do not have a royal charter. One of the main differences is that the governing body recommends a president, who is then appointed by Council.
            
            There are also six permanent private halls, which were founded by different Christian denominations, and still retain their religious character today.
            
            Undergraduates are admitted to 32 of the colleges and permanent private halls. All colleges accept applications from mature students, while Harris Manchester College is solely for mature students.

            Campion Hall and Green Templeton, Kellogg, Linacre, Nuffield, Reuben, St Antony’s, St Cross and Wolfson Colleges admit only postgraduate students. All Souls is unique among Oxford colleges because it has
            no student members; all are Fellows, except the Warden.
            University, Balliol, and Merton Colleges are the oldest and were established by the 13th century.
            
            Green Templeton, which came into existence in 2008 following the merger of Green and Templeton Colleges, is the University’s newest college, and Reuben College, which was founded by the University in 2019, is the newest society.

            The role of the colleges and halls and the University in student life
            Colleges, societies and halls:
            select and admit undergraduate students, and select postgraduate students after they are admitted by the University
            provide accommodation, meals, common rooms, libraries, sports and social facilities, and pastoral care for their students
            are responsible for students’ undergraduate tutorial teaching and welfare
            The University:
            determines the content of the courses within which college teaching takes place 
            organises lectures and seminars
            provides a wide range of resources for teaching and learning in the form of libraries, laboratories, museums, computing facilities, etc
            admits and supervises postgraduate students
            examines theses
            sets and marks examinations
            awards degrees
            Divisions, departments and GLAM
            Oxford University is divided into four academic divisions. Within these divisions are numerous departments, faculties and schools. Oxford’s museums, libraries and collections provide an outstanding resource for the University and work closely with divisions to deliver teaching.
            
            Oxford University Press, one of the largest and most successful university print presses in the world, is also a department of the University, while the Department for Continuing Education exists to enable Oxford to reach students beyond the full-time student body.
